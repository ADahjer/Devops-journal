# Linux

## What is Linux?
Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system.
An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldnâ€™t function.

Linux is a Unix-based operating system widely used in servers, development, and DevOps environments.  
It is open source and can be used in multiple distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, etc.).

## Why am I learning Linux?
- Most cloud servers run on Linux.
- It is essential for DevOps and system administration.
- It allows me to use automation, scripting, and container tools.

## Key Concepts
- **Kernel**: The core of the operating system that manages hardware and system resources. 
- **Shell**: A command-line interface that allows users to interact with the system (e.g., Bash, Zsh). 
- **Package Management**: Tools to install, update, and remove software (`apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pacman`).
