# Notes and Learning Tips

- Always add practical examples with each concept
- Write notes as if I was explaining to my "future self"
- Document common errors and how I solved them
- Prefer quality over quantity: understand a few commands well instead of memorizing many
- Review and clean duplicate notes every 2 weeks
- Keep sessions short: 45 min learning + 15 min break
- Use official documentation as the main source
