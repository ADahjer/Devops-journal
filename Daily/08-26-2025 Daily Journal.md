# DAILY NOTE
## Tuesday, August 26th, 2025
***
### Journal

Today I learned how to setup git and connect it with GitHub.
- Installed git via Winget and configured an identity with the following commands:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Asmith Dahjer"
git config --global user.email "myemail@example.com"
```
- Created a repository to save my learning notes (this vault) with the `git init` command
- created `.gitignore` file to ignore files or folders I donâ€™t want to upload to GitHub
- Connect Local Repository with GitHub
- Push the changes to GitHub
***
