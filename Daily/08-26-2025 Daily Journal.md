# DAILY NOTE
## Tuesday, August 26th, 2025
***
### Journal

Today I learned how to setup git and connect it with GitHub.
- Installed git via download from the [Official Website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and configured an identity with the following command:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Asmith Dahjer"
git config --global user.email "myemail@example.com"
```
- Created a repository to save my learning notes (this vault) with the `git init` command
- created `.gitignore` file to ignore files or folders I donâ€™t want to upload to GitHub

### Tasks
- [x] Install Git
- [x] Configure user identity
- [x] Create local repo
- [ ] Push repo to GitHub
- [ ] Review basic Git commands tomorrow
