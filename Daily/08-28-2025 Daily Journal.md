# DAILY NOTE
## Thursday, August 28th, 2025
***
### Journal

Every time I’ve tried to approach Linux in the past, I ended up using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instead of installing a full distribution. This time, I wanted to do it the right way and set up a proper Linux environment.

The only problem was that I didn’t know where to start. So yesterday I spent the whole afternoon researching and testing different Linux distribution. After like 4-5 hours, countless videos, browsed subredits and installing a few distros in a VM (Virtual Machine). I decided to go with **Arch Linux**

Today I researched how to install Arch and learned a few commands and tools that helped me during the installation process:
- `pacman` → Package manager for Arch Linux
- `lsblk` → Show a list of all disks
- `cfdisk` → Make disk partitioning
***
### Tasks
- [x] Decide which distro use 
- [x] Learn how to install that distro
- [x] Learn basic package manager commands

### Related Notes
- [[pacman]]
- [[Linux]]


> [!NOTE]
> I forgot to log how do I install Arch Linux. Mainly because I installed it as a dual boot with my Windows 11.
> Tomorrow’s plan is to install again Arch on a VM to keep a log file of the installation process.
> For now I’ll leave this note and gonna remove it tomorrow when I add the “guide” to call it somehow, about Arch installation along as why do I chose Arch and other stuff in found interesting while doing the research and deciding which distro use.
