# Learning notes

This repository will contain my learning notes about Sysadmin, Cloud and DevOps topics.

**Goal**: Build a structured and practical system to track my progress and keep everything in one place.

## Structure
- **00 - GENERAL →** General information, road map, tips, etc.
- **01 - [[LINUX]] →** Commands, administration, shell scripting ([[01 - LINUX/README|README]])
- **02 - Networking →** Concepts, troubleshooting
- **03 - Git** → Workflow, commands
- **04 - Docker →** Containers and orchestration
- **05 - Cloud →** Amazon Web Services _(AWS)_
- **06 - CI/CD →** Pipelines, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **07 - Infrastructure as Code →** Terraform, Ansible
- **08 - Security →** Best practices, monitoring

## Conventions
- Every folder should contain a “README.md” as an index
- Notes must include: short theory + example + command/output
- Document errors and how I solved them
